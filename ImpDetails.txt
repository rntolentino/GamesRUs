Justification for Children: 
ArrayList Class  : Decided to use an arraylist due to the fact that I want quick access to the elements. 

GENERIC CLASS: 
I decided to make a generic Tree class (GenTree). The class MenuTree extends GenTree using the specific type of InvyNode (GenTree<InvyNode>),to learn more about the class 
look at the file itself. 

RESOURCES USED:

What I wish I would have added...
    If I had more time I would love to add graphics to the project, so the user could actually feel like they are shopping online. Moreover, I would like to breakdown the Games 
    category and categorize the games by the console type and model, this would be a bit more tedious. I would also breakdown the Console and Toys category and categorize the both
    by brand. For my data structure, an arbitrary tree, this means that for the parent node accessories the user can only add to the grandchildren of the accessories node. The user 
    cannot make new children for the parent node accessories. For the parent node toys the user can only create children for the parent node, not grandchildren. For the parent 
    node consoles the user can only create children for the parent node, not grandchildren. For the parent node games the user can only create children for the parent node, 
    not grandchildren.Unfortunately, I don't have enough time to include the feature of allowing the user to modify all the children and grandchildren to whichever node they would 
    like.
